#jdi mini project

Use psd designs to make s simple frontend design for displaying cars from a database.

Thought I'd install and try both zurb foundation and phalcon for this mini project. Installed phalcon to work on my pre-existing MAMP setup, which was fairly simple.

I mainly used foundation for handling script preprocessing like compiling the sass/scss files. I didn't use many of foundations built-in sass styles but had a good look through them so I have a clearer idea for future projects.

I wasn't sure how much of the car system you wanted me to make, so I just pulled all items from the "Cars" table and displayed them on a single page. In terms of front end functionality, the navigation doesn't actually function as there is only the one page, but the site is responsive. As there wasn't much php in the project, and I wasn't getting any errors, I didn't use PHPUnit.

It took me about 3.5 hours to design the front end from the psd files. The rest (maybe 7 hours) was spent reading through phalcon and foundation's documentation for a better understanding.

** Really like phalcon- seems very flexible and lightweight. Doesn't have a lot of the design clutter you get when making backend modules in silverstripe.
